Understood — we’ll build the Smart Callout module to account for unionized environments as follows:

⚖️ Union-Aware Callout Logic (Configurable per Location)

Settings (adjustable in LUCCCA Admin Panel):
- Enable “Union Scheduling Rules” toggle
- Priority ranking order:
  1. Seniority (hire date)
  2. Classification (job tier/role)
  3. Scheduled days off
  4. Weekly hour cap
  5. Skill compatibility

Shift Fill Logic:
- If union mode is on:
  - Top candidates are sorted by seniority first
  - Automatically exclude non-union staff (if required)
  - Log callout response + acceptance per union policy

Audit Trail:
- Every callout is logged with:
  - Timestamp
  - Order of outreach
  - Response time
  - Final selection
  - Union override reason (if applicable)

This ensures LUCCCA remains compliant while still empowering smart staffing decisions.
