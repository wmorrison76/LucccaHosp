## 🚀 How to Access

### Method 1: Via Board.jsx Panel Registry
The CakeBuilder is registered in `frontend/src/board/Board.jsx`:
- **Panel Key:** `cakebuilder`
- **Title:** 🎂 CakeBuilder
- **Type:** Full-screen panel

The panel will automatically load when accessed through the board navigation system.

### Method 2: Direct Component Import
```typescript
import { CakeBuilderPage, IntakeForm, CakeBuilder, ProductionScheduler, CakeGallery } from '@/modules/PastryLibrary/CakeBuilder';
```

### Method 3: Create Demo Page
Create a new page component:
```typescript
import { CakeBuilderPage } from '@/modules/PastryLibrary/CakeBuilder';

export default function CakeBuilderDemo() {
  return <CakeBuilderPage />;
}
```
