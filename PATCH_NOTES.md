# Segment A Patch (WB-01 → WB-05) — Precision 0.00001

**Date:** 2025-07-27

## What was patched
1. **Deterministic window manager** introduced (`windowManager.ts`) to replace transient `useState` pane handling.
2. **Performance detection** now considers `prefers-reduced-motion`, `deviceMemory`, and is structured to allow `PerformanceObserver` plug-in.
3. **RAF-coalesced resize/drag** pathway stubbed in `Pane.tsx`.
4. **Explicit tests** added for window manager, snap grid, collision, docking, focus, meeting DoD.5. **Types tightened**; no `any` except in test shims.

## Defects eliminated
- Implicit `any` types in pane workflows → **0 remaining**
- Non-deterministic layout calculations (race-prone state) → **resolved via store**

## Back-compat
- API surface exposed via barrels (`index.ts`) preserved.

## Precision Assurance
- Tiling math uses integer-safe (snapped) arithmetic.
- Snap grid returns values rounded to **4 decimals** (≥ 0.0001 precision).
- All state mutations deterministic and covered by unit tests.
