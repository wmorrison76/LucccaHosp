Perfect ‚Äî let‚Äôs stitch everything into a single, comprehensive system design that covers the full lifecycle: from shelf organization ‚Üí digital sheets ‚Üí production/prepped integration ‚Üí forecasting ‚Üí ordering. This will combine your phased plan + industry best practices + LUCCCA‚Äôs architecture (modular, scalable, TRON/Apple style).

# üåê Comprehensive Production & Raw Ingredient System (End-to-End Blueprint for LUCCCA / Echo)

## 1. Foundation Layer ‚Äì Physical & Digital Standardization

### 1.1 Physical Storage
- Logical Flow (Shelf-to-Sheet)
  - Organize walk-ins, freezers, dry storage like a book (top ‚Üí bottom, left ‚Üí right).
  - Label each shelf/zone with a Location Code (W1-S3 = Walk-in 1, Shelf 3).
  - Group items by category (Proteins, Produce, Dairy, Dry Goods).
- FIFO / FEFO
  - Physical placement: older stock in front, new deliveries behind.
  - Labels include: Item Name, Received Date, Expiration/Prep Date, Lot ID.
- Par Visibility
  - Place laminated ‚ÄúPar Tags‚Äù on shelves for quick visual check (e.g., ‚ÄúPar: 3 cases‚Äù).

### 1.2 Digital Setup
- Item Master Database
  - Raw Ingredients (purchase units, vendor packs, conversions, allergens).
  - Prepped/Finished Goods (recipes, yields, shelf life).
  - Storage Locations (zones + walk order sequence).
  - Vendors (lead times, pack rules).
- Consistent Counting Unit
  - Each item locked to a Primary UOM (lb, oz, each, qt).
  - Conversions handle cases/packs ‚Üí primary UOM.
- JSON Schema & Builder Integration
  - Already prototyped in your starter kit (items, prepped, pars, forecasts, orders).
  - Builder.io can consume the schemas for UI-driven forms and dashboards.

## 2. Inventory Operations ‚Äì Shelf-to-Sheet & Daily Counts

### 2.1 Shelf-to-Sheet Workflow
1. Staff walks storage in sequence order (from Locations table).
2. Count entry via tablet/phone UI (mirrors shelf order).
3. Counts auto-convert into primary UOM.
4. For lot-tracked items ‚Üí capture lot_id, received_date, expires_at.

### 2.2 Digital Sheets
- Count Sheet Columns: Item, Storage Code, Count Qty/UOM, Unit Price, Total Value.
- Separation by Area: Walk-in, Freezer, Dry Goods, Production Cooler.
- Auto-Valuation: Multiply by most recent vendor cost.
- Variance Checks: Compare theoretical (expected) vs actual usage ‚Üí highlight discrepancies.

## 3. Production & Prepped Item Integration

### 3.1 Prepped Items (Recipes)
- Each prepped item = recipe card:
  - Raw ingredient lines (qty, uom, yield%, loss%).
  - Output (default_batch_output, shelf_life_days).
  - Linked HACCP critical control notes.

### 3.2 Production Planning
- Input Sources:
  - Forecasts (guest counts, BEOs, sales history, seasonality).
  - Pars (minimum stock requirement).
- Workflow:
  1. Forecast says: 18 qt Demi needed.
  2. System checks On-Hand Prepped: 4 qt.
  3. Shortfall = 14 qt ‚Üí 3 Batches (5 qt each).
  4. Recipe expands to raw ingredients (bones, onions, tomato paste).
  5. Raw needs deducted from stock; residual shortages flagged for ordering.

### 3.3 Live Prepped Inventory
- Production Sheet (daily use):
  - Kitchen logs batches made.
  - System auto-depletes raw items, adds to prepped stock.
- Sales Integration:
  - POS sales ‚Üí deduct finished/prepped inventory.
  - Variances logged (expected vs actual usage).

## 4. Ordering & Purchasing Integration

### 4.1 Ordering Logic
For each raw item:
1. Par Shortfall = Par ‚àí On-Hand (with safety stock).
2. Production Need = Residual from recipe expansion.
3. Total Need = Par Shortfall + Production Need.
4. Pack Conversion: Convert to vendor pack size.
5. Order Rounding: Apply order_multiple.
6. PO Draft: Group by vendor, reasons tagged (PAR, PRODUCTION).

### 4.2 Purchase Workflow
- Suggested Order Guide auto-generated nightly.
- Chef/Manager Approval step before submission.
- Vendor Integration: Export via email, API, or EDI.

## 5. Forecasting & Analytics Layer

### 5.1 Forecast Drivers
- Guest counts (reservations, occupancy, events).
- Historical POS data (item-level sales trends).
- Seasonality (holidays, summer, etc.).
- External: weather, lunar phase (if you want Echo‚Äôs predictive flair).

### 5.2 Dynamic Pars
- Auto-adjust par levels based on average usage √ó days of cover + safety buffer.
- Seasonal adjustments flagged by forecast.

### 5.3 Analytics Dashboards
- Theoretical vs Actual Usage (variance).
- Waste/Spoilage Logs.
- COGS % and Item Cost Trends.
- Vendor Performance: lead time, cost variance.

## 6. Advanced Features & Echo Integration
- Mobile-first counts ‚Üí Echo guides staff through shelf walk (‚ÄúNext: W1-S3, 10 lb onions‚Äù).
- AI-driven alerts ‚Üí ‚ÄúChef, you‚Äôll be short on bones for next week‚Äôs demi unless you order 80 lb today.‚Äù
- Self-learning yields ‚Üí Echo refines trim yield % by comparing prep logs vs actual variance.
- Multi-site transfers ‚Üí Commissary ‚Üí Outlet tracked as internal POs.
- Time Machine Mode (Zelda/Odin tie-in): full audit rollback of counts, orders, and production runs.

# ‚úÖ End-to-End Example Workflow
1. Shelf-to-Sheet Count
   - Staff counts 20 lb onions (par 40 lb).
2. System detects shortfall
   - Onion shortfall = 20 lb.
3. Production Plan triggered
   - Forecast requires 3 pans prepped onions.
   - Conversion: 1 pan = 15 lb raw onions (yield 0.89).
   - Need 45 lb raw ‚Üí system subtracts current 20 lb ‚Üí 25 lb deficit.
4. Auto Order Draft
   - Vendor pack = 50 lb bag ‚Üí Suggest 1 bag from Sysco.
5. Daily Prep Log
   - Staff logs ‚Äú3 pans onions sliced.‚Äù
   - System reduces onions by 45 lb, increases prepped onions by 3 pans.
6. POS Sales
   - 60 salads sold, each uses 0.25 pan sliced onions ‚Üí deducts 15 pans.
   - Prepped onion stock falls below par ‚Üí auto-alert.
