# Menu Analytics & Best Seller Tracking Guide

## Overview

The Menu Analytics system tracks which items in your BEO/REO documents are best sellers across different outlets. This data-driven approach helps inform menu revision decisions by identifying top performers and underperforming items that may need replacement.

## Key Features

### üìä **Performance Tracking**
- **Revenue Analysis**: Track total revenue generated by each menu item
- **Order Frequency**: Monitor how often items are selected across events
- **Trend Analysis**: Identify increasing, decreasing, or stable performance patterns
- **Outlet Comparison**: Compare item performance across different venues/outlets

### üéØ **Smart Recommendations**
- **Keep**: Top-performing items that should remain featured
- **Promote**: Hidden gems with high performance but low visibility
- **Modify**: Items with declining performance that need attention
- **Replace**: Consistently underperforming items to consider removing
- **Review**: Items with inconsistent or insufficient data

### üìà **Menu Health Scoring**
- Overall menu performance score (0-100%)
- Category performance breakdown
- Revenue optimization opportunities
- Trend analysis and forecasting

## How It Works

### Data Collection
The system automatically analyzes:
1. **BEO/REO Documents**: Extracts ordered items and quantities
2. **Event Details**: Guest count, date, venue, event type
3. **Revenue Data**: Item pricing and total revenue per event
4. **Historical Patterns**: Seasonal and trend analysis

### Performance Calculation
Items are scored based on:
- **Revenue Weight (40%)**: Total revenue generated
- **Frequency Weight (30%)**: How often the item is ordered
- **Trend Weight (20%)**: Performance trajectory over time
- **Margin Weight (10%)**: Profit margin (when available)

### Ranking System
- Items ranked by percentile within their category
- **Top 25%**: High performers (Keep/Promote)
- **25-75%**: Average performers (Review/Modify)
- **Bottom 25%**: Poor performers (Replace)
