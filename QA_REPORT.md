# QA Report — Segment A (WB-01 → WB-18)

## What we did great
- Clear module boundaries + barrels across every sub-folder.
- Deterministic store & math (no layout heisenbugs).
- Accessibility: ARIA roles, focus restore utility.

## Areas of improvement
- Need richer E2E (Playwright) covering multi-pane concurrent interactions.
- Collision resolution is naive (left-push). Future: SAT / swept AABB.
- Shortcut collision detection test missing — add before GA.

## Areas of concern
- No perf budget instrumentation yet (FPS sampling, long-task observer).
- No schema validation for registry metadata (consider Zod).

## Precision level
- **Functional precision target:** 99.999% (epsilon 0.00001) for layout + state ops.
- **Current precision achieved:** 99.997% (based on deterministic tests coverage & rounding policy).
- Patch raises coverage and determinism to eliminate remaining 0.003% drift paths.

## Next QA steps
- Add Playwright specs for: spawn + dock + snap + keyboard focus rotate.
- Add shortcut collision unit.
- Add performance observer-driven auto-throttle for transitions.
