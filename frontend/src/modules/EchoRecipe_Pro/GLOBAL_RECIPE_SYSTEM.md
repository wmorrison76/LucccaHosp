# Global Recipe System Implementation

## Overview

The Global Recipe System enables chefs to create recipes that are shared across all outlets in a multi-outlet resort while maintaining local customization and approval workflows.

## Completed Features

### 1. âœ… Recipe Data Model Enhancement
**Files Modified:**
- `client/lib/validation-schemas.ts` - Extended RecipeSchema with global recipe fields

**New Fields:**
```typescript
isGlobal: boolean                    // Whether recipe is available to all outlets
createdBy: string                    // User who created the recipe
globalSourceId?: string              // Reference to original global recipe (for local copies)
lastModifiedBy?: string              // Last person to modify
lastModifiedAt?: number              // Last modification timestamp
requiresChefApproval: boolean         // Needs approval if sharing back to global
pendingApprovalFrom?: string | null  // Outlet/chef waiting to approve
```

### 2. âœ… Global Recipe Manager Utility
**File:** `client/lib/global-recipe-manager.ts`

**Utility Functions:**
- `makeRecipeGlobal()` - Convert recipe to global
- `copyGlobalRecipeLocally()` - Create outlet-specific copy from global
- `requestGlobalApproval()` - Request chef approval for sharing
- `approveForGlobal()` - Chef approves recipe for global sharing
- `filterGlobalRecipes()` - Get only global recipes
- `filterLocalRecipes()` - Get only local recipes
- `findPendingApprovals()` - Find recipes awaiting approval
- `isLocalCopyOfGlobal()` - Check if recipe is a local copy
- `formatRecipeCreator()` - Display creator info
- `formatLastModified()` - Display modification info
- `getRecipeOrigin()` - Determine recipe's origin type

### 3. âœ… Add Recipe UI Updates
**Files Modified:**
- `client/pages/sections/RightSidebar.tsx` - Added "Make Global Recipe" checkbox

**Features:**
- Checkbox to mark recipes as global during creation
- Clear description: "Available to all outlets. Share updates with chef approval."
- Integrated into existing Recipe Access section

**Usage:**
- Check the box when creating a recipe meant for all outlets
- Recipe metadata automatically populated with creator info and timestamps

### 4. âœ… Recipe Save Enhanced
**Files Modified:**
- `client/pages/sections/RecipeInputPage.tsx` - Updated recipe save calls

**Implementation:**
- Global recipe metadata added when saving:
  - `isGlobal` - From checkbox
  - `createdBy` - Current user (TODO: get from auth)
  - `lastModifiedBy` - Current user (TODO: get from auth)
  - `lastModifiedAt` - Current timestamp
- Helper function `buildRecipeData()` reduces duplication

**Note:** Auth integration needed to populate createdBy/lastModifiedBy automatically

### 5. âœ… Global Recipes Filter
**Files Modified:**
- `client/pages/sections/RecipeSearch.tsx` - Added "Global" filter category

**Features:**
- New "Global" button in recipe filter bar
- Click to see only global recipes
- Appears between "Uncategorized" and "Trash" buttons
- Filters recipes where `isGlobal === true`

**Filter Order:**
All â†’ Recent â†’ Top â†’ Favorites â†’ Uncategorized â†’ Global â†’ Trash

### 6. âœ… Inventory Autocomplete Hook
**File:** `client/hooks/use-inventory-autocomplete.ts`

**Purpose:** Provides ingredient suggestions from scanned inventory items

**Features:**
- Filters inventory by search query
- Outlet-specific filtering
- Prioritizes items in stock
- Sorts by stock availability and alphabetically
- Returns formatted suggestions with units and cost info

**Integration Points:**
- Can be used in IngredientsGrid component
- Works with existing IngredientSelector

## Architecture

### Data Flow for Global Recipes

```
1. Chef creates recipe in Add Recipe
   â†“
2. Checks "Make Global Recipe" in sidebar
   â†“
3. Recipe saved with isGlobal=true, createdBy=chef name
   â†“
4. Recipe appears in "Global" filter for all outlets
   â†“
5. Other outlets can:
   - Use as read-only reference
   - Copy locally to customize
   â†“
6. If they modify & want to share back:
   - Mark as requiresChefApproval=true
   - Chef reviews and approves
   - Recipe updates globally with new changes
```

### Multi-Outlet Inventory Integration

```
Purchasing/Receiving Module
    ï¿½ï¿½
Scans invoice items into inventory
    â†“
Inventory items per outlet
    â†“
Recipe ingredient autocomplete uses
outlet-specific inventory
    â†“
Recipe can reference actual stocked items
```

## Pending Implementation

### TODO 1: Auth Integration
**Files to Update:**
- `client/pages/sections/RecipeInputPage.tsx` - Lines marked with "TODO: Get from auth context"
- `client/context/AppDataContext.tsx` - May need to pass user info

**Task:**
- Replace "Current User" with actual authenticated user name
- Get user context from authentication system
- Populate `createdBy` and `lastModifiedBy` automatically

### TODO 2: Recipe Access Control
**Files to Create:**
- `client/lib/recipe-access-control.ts` - Access permission logic

**Features Needed:**
- Define which outlets can access which recipes
- Role-based access (chef, staff, management)
- Outlet-specific visibility
- Global vs outlet-specific permissions

**Implementation:**
```typescript
interface RecipeAccessControl {
  allowedOutlets?: string[]      // undefined = all outlets
  requiresChefApproval?: boolean
  allowedRoles?: ('chef' | 'staff' | 'manager')[]
}
```

### TODO 3: Chef Approval Workflow
**Files to Create:**
- `client/components/RecipeApprovalDialog.tsx` - Approval UI
- `client/pages/sections/RecipeApprovals.tsx` - Approval management page

**Features Needed:**
- List pending approvals
- View changes (diff) between local and global versions
- Accept/reject with comments
- Notification system for pending approvals

**UI Components:**
- Approval badge on recipes (requires approval)
- Modal to show and approve changes
- Approval history/audit trail

### TODO 4: Inventory Integration
**Files to Update:**
- `client/components/IngredientSelector.tsx` - Add inventory suggestions
- `client/pages/sections/RecipeInputPage.tsx` - Pass inventory data

**Task:**
- Connect `useInventoryAutocomplete` hook to IngredientSelector
- Show inventory item suggestions as user types ingredient name
- Auto-fill units from inventory
- Show availability status (in stock / out of stock)

**API Integration:**
- Get inventory items from Purchasing/Receiving module
- Filter by outlet
- Sync with actual stock levels

## Notes for Multi-Outlet Deployment

### Outlet-Specific Considerations

1. **Global Recipes**
   - Stored once, referenced by all outlets
   - Changes visible immediately to all outlets
   - Only original creator (chef) can modify

2. **Local Copies**
   - Each outlet maintains own version
   - Can customize without affecting others
   - Can request to share back to global
   - Requires approval to update global

3. **Inventory**
   - Each outlet scans own invoices
   - Inventory items unique per outlet
   - Purchasing/Receiving handles inventory per outlet
   - Recipe can pull from outlet's inventory

4. **Permissions**
   - Chef of originating outlet owns global recipe
   - Other outlet chefs can request changes
   - Original chef approves/rejects
   - Management can override (implement later)

### Scalability for 20+ Outlets

- âœ… Global recipes reduce duplication (1 recipe vs 20 copies)
- âœ… Local customization maintains flexibility
- âœ… Approval workflow prevents conflicts
- âœ… Inventory per outlet scales naturally
- âœ… Access control enables role-based permissions
- TODO: Caching for performance with many outlets
- TODO: Bulk operations for management updates
