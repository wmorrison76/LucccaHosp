## 🔧 Technical Details

### Architecture
- **State Management**: React hooks with custom `useHistory` for undo/redo
- **Storage**: Browser localStorage with metadata
- **Export**: Canvas-based rendering to PDF/SVG
- **Gallery**: Direct integration with existing AppDataContext

### Performance Considerations
- History limited to 50 states (prevents memory bloat)
- Auto-save debounced at 30 seconds
- Designs limited to 20 most recent (localStorage quota)
- Image picker uses virtual scrolling

### Browser Compatibility
- All modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- LocalStorage support required
- PDF/SVG require jsPDF and html2canvas libraries
