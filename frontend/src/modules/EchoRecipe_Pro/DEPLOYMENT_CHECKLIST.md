## Notes

- **Timeline**: Estimate 2-3 weeks total for full production readiness
- **Team**: Requires coordination between backend, frontend, DevOps, QA, and Product teams
- **Contingency**: Plan for 1 week contingency buffer
- **Documentation**: Keep this checklist updated as you progress
- **Regular Review**: Review checklist weekly and mark completed items

## Emergency Rollback Plan

If critical issues discovered post-launch:

1. **Immediate**: Trigger rollback to previous stable deployment
2. **Notify**: Inform all stakeholders of issue and rollback
3. **Investigate**: Root cause analysis in parallel
4. **Fix**: Address issues in development environment
5. **Test**: Extensive testing before redeployment
6. **Redeploy**: Slow rollout with monitoring

Keep this checklist accessible to the entire team throughout the deployment process.
