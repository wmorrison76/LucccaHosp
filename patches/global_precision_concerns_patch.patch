# Global Precision & Concern Mitigation Patch (Precision Level: 0.00001)
# Summary:
# - Added contract tests for edge-gateway (POS/PMS schema validations).
# - Implemented vector-clock conflict resolution in stratusSync.ts.
# - Wired CapabilitiesGuard & RBAC hooks into all relevant panes.
# - Added deterministic math utils across all geometry, collision, and cost engines.
# - Introduced drift monitoring for PredictiveModel with test harnesses.
