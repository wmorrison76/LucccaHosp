# EchoCore Batches 7–14 — Delivery Report

## Summary
This master bundle aggregates Batches 7–14 (160 files). We applied a precision hardening patch to the **first group (Batch 7)** to ensure numerical determinism at **ε = 1e-5 (0.00001)** and removed any potential float-instability sources in geometry, layout, and telemetry timestamp math.

## What Went Great
- **Architecture cohesion**: Clear segment boundaries (A/B/C) with strong barrel exports.
- **Extensibility**: PaneRegistry + CommandRegistry patterns make feature growth predictable.
- **Observability-first**: TelemetryConsole + OpenTelemetry bootstrap landed early (Batches 10–12).
- **Test layering**: Unit, integration, Storybook, and RFC/ADR scaffolding delivered consistently.

## Areas of Improvement
- **Precision discipline** was not uniformly enforced across geometry and layout math (addressed by this patch).
- **Edge Gateway contracts** need contract tests for each POS/PMS schema (AN-01 → AN-04) — currently placeholders.
- **RBAC & Predictive Analytics** (Batch 13) need model calibration fixtures and drift monitoring jobs.
- **Storybook controls**: Some panes (Ordering, SystemStatus) still need interactive knobs for device perf and offline simulation.

## Areas of Concern / Risk
- **Placeholders vs. prod-ready code**: Some modules are still stubs (intended, but must be tracked in your task board).
- **Float math in collision & snap grid**: Previously used naive `Math.round` — now replaced with deterministic helpers and Big.js-like decimal ops.
- **Sync conflict resolution**: Vector-clock strategy is drafted but not implemented (AN-03).

## Precision Level & Enforcement
- Target: **ε = 1e-5 (0.00001)**
- Enforced via:
  - `preciseRound(value, 5)` helper (wrapping Intl.NumberFormat or toFixed based on env) for UI-facing values.
  - `approxEqual(a, b, 1e-5)` for geometry comparisons.
  - `Decimal`-style deterministic arithmetic in snap/collision pipelines (polyfilled for now).

## Patch Coverage (Batch 7)
- **WB-09 snapGrid.ts**: Introduced `EPS = 1e-5`, deterministic rounding, and subpixel-stable snapping.
- **WB-10 collision.ts**: SAT with epsilon and deterministic sort order for stable resolution.
- **WB-03 AutoLayoutEngine.ts**: Layout hashing to ensure reproducibility & snapshot tests.
- **WB-04 usePerfMode.ts**: Explicit thresholds + hysteresis to avoid mode-flap.
- **FG-04 AutoPriorityEngine.ts**: Priority scores normalized & clamped with deterministic tie-breakers.

## Next Actions
1. Replace placeholders with production code per your CSV board ordering; link each PR to an ADR or RFC.
2. Add **contract tests** to `edge-gateway` for each inbound schema.
3. Roll out **prediction drift monitor** & retrain hooks for the analytics module.
4. Wire **RBAC guards** into all panes (CapabilitesGuard + useRoleCheck).
